# Chat-App-Mern
The Real-Time Chat Application is a web-based messaging platform that allows users to engage in instant communication with each other. Built on the MERN stack, the application leverages MongoDB for data storage, Express.js for server-side logic, React.js for the user interface, and Node.js for the backend.
